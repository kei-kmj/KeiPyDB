# keiPyDB

`keiPyDB` is a lightweight, Python-based database inspired by Java's `SimpleDB`. The goal is to create a minimalistic, file-based database system for small-scale applications.

## Features (Planned)
- **File-based Storage**: Store data in files with efficient read/write operations.
- **Schema-less Design**: Supports dynamic, flexible data structures.
- **Query Language**: Implement a simple query syntax similar to SQL.
- **Transactions**: Basic support for ACID transactions.
